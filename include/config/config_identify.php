- with option 1, if the user's autologin cookie is stealed (or someone reaches a machine on which the user is logged in), the attacker will be logged out the next time the legitimate user logs in manually into his account (from anywhere).
Note that if the user himself uses more than one PC (e.g. at work and home), with this option he can be logged in only on one of them at every moment.
Note: with this option, a database update operation is needed every time the user logs in.

- option 2 can be used when higher security is needed, but notice that it needs a database update operation on every request for each logged in user.

with this option set to true, a logged in user can change his autologin key at any time which will cause other possibly logged in systems to lose access to the account; this can be useful e.g. when a logged in machine is left somewhere inadvertently or in the case of an authentication cookie theft.

note that this config is ignored when change_autologin_key_upon_login=2,
because when change_autologin_key_upon_login=2 autologin key is changed automatically at each request anyway.

$dont_enforce_autoloign_age_sever_side_when_change_autologin_key_upon_login_is_zero=0;
//oh man this is a really long variable name ;D
//when change_autologin_key_upon_login is set to 0, user's autologin key is not changed in each request and/or when logging in, so a user can log into his account from several machines and remain login from all of them at the same time. but since autologin expiration time is checked on the server side too, and only the expiration time of the last login is recorded on the server, this can cause problems both from the point of view of functionality and from the pov of security, so u can, by setting this variable, specify to ignore the server side expiration times when change_autologin_key_upon_login is set to 0. but i recommend to leave it to the default (0) unless enabling it seems really unavoidable.
//possible values: 0: no / 1: only for the admin account / 2: only for ordinary users / 3: for all

$max_session_autologin_age=12*60*60;//in seconds / 0: infinite
//by session autologin i mean autologins that r alive/valid until the browser is closed. those autologin cookies r set with an expiration time of 0 which causes the browser to keep them alive until the browser is closed. but this functionality can pose a risk from the security point of view, because e.g. if an attacker steals such autologin cookies, he can use them to access the user's account for a potentially infinite duration. so we can set a reasonable maximum age for those autologins with this config var.
//note that the expiration time is checked on the server side and thus can't be circumvented by any means from the client side.
