============ in v2.3.02 (Feb 2014) ===============- fixed open redirect vulnerability in change_lang.php by adding xsrf protection to it.============ in v2.3.01 (jan 2014) =========================== in v2.3 (jan 2014) ===============- possibility to require email verification for account email change.- separate configs for admin account regarding autologin key change.see the new config vars $admin_change_autologin_key_upon_login and $admin_change_autologin_key_upon_logout in config_identify.php, and $admin_change_autologin_key_upon_new_password in config_password_change_or_reset.php.- fixed a bug in IP block logging (ip block logging occured every time an incorrect login attempt was made against an account that had disabled ip blocks).- some other minor improvements and bug fixes.============ in v2.1 (Dec 2013) ===============- an sql injection bug was fixed.- passwords weren't hashed (client side) when captcha was verified with ajax - fixed.- added password entry to admin operations.=========================================================== in v2.0 (Dec 2013) ===============- several bugs fixed (some where security related but not critical).- now captcha is dynamically added to the login form when it is needed for the entered username; thus no need to refresh the page a second time only to add a captcha.- ajax captcha verification for all forms.- configurable autologin duration options in the login formseparate settings for admin and ordinary users (utmost flexibility!)see autologin_ages and admin_autologin_ages config vars in config_identify.php.- now can specify login upon register autologin duration.see the login_upon_register_age config var in config_register.php.- autologin (cookie) expiration time now is also checked on the server side which leads to more confidence and higher security since it can not be bypassed by a hacker or violated because of client side problems (like wrong client date/time)- now u can set a maximum duration for browser session autologins.this seems very good or even necessary for security.see the max_session_autologin_age config var in config_identify.php.===============================================
